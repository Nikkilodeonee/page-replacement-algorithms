# Page Replacement Algorithms Simulator

## Description
This project simulates and compares two classic page replacement algorithms used in operating system memory management: FIFO (First In, First Out) and MFU (Most Frequently Used). It models how pages are accessed and replaced in limited memory frames and studies how these algorithms perform under various parameters like sequence length, frame count, and locality of page references.

## Features
- Object-oriented implementation of FIFO and MFU algorithms.
- Generation of randomized page access sequences simulating locality.
- Experimental framework running multiple tests with varying parameters.
- Visual bar charts comparing page fault counts.
- Console tables summarizing experimental results.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install matplotlib numpy`
3. Run the script `Algorytmy-zastepowania-stron.py`.
4. View plots and printed tables for analysis.
